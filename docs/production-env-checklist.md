# Production Environment Checklist

This document lists every environment variable required before deploying SouthernVT to production on Vercel. Set these in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables → Production**.

---

## Quick Status

The API Status page at `/basecamp/settings/api` reads real env vars at runtime and shows **Configured** or **Missing** for each service.

---

## Required Variables

### Core

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://www.southernvt.com` | Canonical public URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://southernvt.com` | Used in email templates |

---

### Supabase

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://<project>.supabase.co` | From Supabase project settings |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJ...` | Public anon key — safe for client |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `eyJ...` | **Server-only.** Never expose to client. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPOSITORY_MODE` | `supabase` | Switches from mock data to live Supabase. Set to `supabase` in production. |

**Required Supabase setup before going live:**
1. Apply all migrations in `supabase/migrations/` to your production project.
2. Enable Email auth in Supabase Auth settings.
3. Set Site URL and Redirect URLs in Supabase Auth → URL Configuration.

**Required Resend setup before going live:**
1. Verify `southernvt.com` as a sending domain in Resend → Domains.
2. Add the DNS records Resend provides (2× TXT for DKIM + 1× MX).
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours).

See `docs/contact-email.md` for full Resend setup guide.

### Square (Optional — for paid business listing upgrades)

Square is not required for launch. Leave these blank until paid upgrades are enabled.

#### Deprecated: Stripe

Stripe was previously scaffolded as the billing provider but was never launched. Do not set Stripe env vars — the Stripe routes now return `410 Gone`.

### Mapbox (Optional)

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | `pk.eyJ1...` | Mapbox public access token |

## Vercel Setup Steps

1. Go to **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**.
2. Add each variable above under the **Production** scope.
3. For variables also needed in Preview/Development, enable those scopes too.
4. After adding all variables, trigger a new deployment.

## Notes

- **Never commit real secrets to git.** Use `.env.local` locally (git-ignored).
- **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`** are server-only. Set them in Vercel but never prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- The `/basecamp/settings/api` page reads env vars at request time and shows live **Configured / Missing** status for each service.
